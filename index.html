            <h2>What is a <span class="rotate-left">panto</span></h2>
            <p><b><span class="rotate-right">Pantomime</span></b> is a type of musical comedy aimed at the entire family. Confusingly, it has nothing to do with miming. It's a british genre, performed in a few other countries, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ireland</li>
                <li>Australia</li>
                <li>Canada</li>
                <li>USA</li>
                <li>Andorra</li>
                <li>Malta</li>
                <li>Jamaica</li>

            <h2><span class="rotate-left">Pantomime conventions</span></h2>
            <p><span class="rotate-right">Panto</span> conventions have changed over the years, and none are mandatory, but here are some of the common tropes of the genre:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The lead boy is often played by a young woman</li>
                <li>There is a <span class="rotate-left">pantomime</span> dame, usually the principal boy's mother, played by a man in drag who makes horrible innuendos</li>
                <li>On that note, lots of innuendos and puns</li>
                <li>Audience participation, particularly singing along, shouting <span class="quote">He's behind you</span>, arguing with characters, and awwwing whenever something remotely sad happens</li>
                <li>Singing and dancing numbers with simple, cheesy choreography, and pop songs rewritten to match the plot of the show</li>
                <li>A pair of people in an animal costume, usually a horse of cow</li>
                <li>Good characters entering from the right, bad characters entering from the left</li>
            </ol>
