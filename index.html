    <h1>Is this a page about pantomimes? Oh no it isn't!</h1>
    <h3>Oh yet it is.</h3>
    <p><b>Pantomime</b> is a type of musical comedy aimed at the entire family. Confusingly, it has nothing to do with miming. It's a british genre, performed in a few other countries, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ireland</li>
        <li>Australia</li>
        <li>Canada</li>
        <li>USA</li>
        <li>Andorra</li>
        <li>Malta</li>
        <li>Jamaica</li>
        <li>Switzerland</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Pantomime conventions</h2>
    <p>Panto conventions have changed over the years, and none are mandatory, but here are some of the common tropes of the genre:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The lead boy is often played by a young woman</li>
        <li>There is a pantomime dame, usually the principal boy's mother, played by a man in drag who makes horrible innuendos</li>
        <li>On that note, lots of innuendos and puns</li>
        <li>Audience participation, particularly singing along, shouting <span class="quote">He's behind you</span>, arguing with characters, and awwwing whenever something remotely sad happens</li>
        <li>Singing and dancing numbers with simple, cheesy choreography, and pop songs rewritten to match the plot of the show</li>
        <li>A pair of people in an animal costume, usually a horse of cow</li>
        <li>Good characters entering from the right, bad characters entering from the left</li>
    </ol>
